## Motivation

I graduated from UW a few months ago never having taken a frontend course or exploring frontend development in any capacity. However, I have always been interested in frontend as its the key to unlocking amazing user experiences.

I followed a tutorial to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. To put these skills to use, I created this game! Yes, everything in this was **raw frontend**. No frameworks, no libraries.

## Instructions

* Match all pairs of similar cards by flipping them
* Click on a card to flip it
* If two cards you flipped are not the same, they will be flipped back (so use your memory!)
* Select your gameboard by clicking on the cards you want to be available

## Gameplay

This game is compatible for any screen size (mobile, desktop, tablet, etc.)
